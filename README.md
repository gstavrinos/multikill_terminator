# MultiKill :warning:

A Terminator plugin that runs the abort command (Ctrl+C) on all open terminals of the active window.

It adds a menu item and also a keyboard shortcut that is currently hardcoded to Alt+C.

To install it, simply copy the multikill.py file to ~/.config/terminator/plugins. If you don't have a `plugins` directory under terminator, create one first!

#### Enjoy! :panda_face:
